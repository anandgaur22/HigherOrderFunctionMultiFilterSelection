# HigherOrderFunction Multi Filter Selection

This project demonstrates **multi-filter selection** using Jetpack Compose in an Android app.  
It allows users to filter food items based on **Budget Friendly, Highly Rated, and Premium** categories.  
It also **handles conflicting filters** (e.g., Budget Friendly + Premium) by displaying a warning message instead of an empty list.  

## Features  
âœ… Multi-filter selection with real-time UI updates  
âœ… Conflict handling for contradictory filters  
âœ… Highlighted selected filters for better UX  
âœ… Optimized filtering logic for efficiency  

Perfect for learning **higher-order functions, Jetpack Compose, and state management** in Kotlin! ðŸš€
